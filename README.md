# JDE_final

Final project for the JDE course by Generation

## Instructions

- Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the variables
  - `URI_PG` is the template for your postgresql server uri
  - Kaggle credentials seem to be optional as I could download without them, but you can fill it in just in case
